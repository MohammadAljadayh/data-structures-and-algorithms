# Singly Linked List

Linked List, like arrays, is a linear data structure. It contains head, tail and length properties. As shown below, each element in linked list is a node, which has a value and a reference to next node, or if itâ€™s tail, points to null. 

## Challenge

this chalanges have the three main points : 

- insert the new node of linked list  at the first Head .

- seacrh inside linked list to check the value is it included or not 

- git all the data in the linked list .  


## Approach & Efficiency
///What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach?


- insert method take one paramter to insert the node in the first linkedlist and have to pointer on it as a new node the head and tails . 

- includes function  take one paramter and looping throw linked list until the next value is equal to null to check if  that is value  inside the linkedlist

- tostring with no paramter looping to all linked list  to rerutn all item in linked list . 



## Big O 

- insert -  O(1)

- seacrh (include) - O(n)

- retrive(toString) - O(n)
